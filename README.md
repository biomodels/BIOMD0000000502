# Model Notes


Messiha2013 - Pentose phosphate pathway model

This model describes the dynamic behaviour of the pentose phosphate pathway
with the inclusion of various enzymes involved in the pathway. The model's
predictions are compared with experimental observations of transient
metabolite concentrations following a glucose pulse.

This model is described in the article:

[Enzyme characterisation and kinetic modelling of pentose phosphate pathway in
yeast.](http://identifiers.org/doi/10.7287/peerj.preprints.146v2)

Abstract:

We present the quantification and kinetic characterisation of the enzymes of
the pentose phosphate pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data are
combined into a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of this system
and allows for the predicting changes in metabolite concentrations and fluxes
in response to perturbations. We use the model to study the response of yeast
to a glucose pulse. We then combine the model with an existing glycolysis one
to study the effect of oxidative stress on carbohydrate metabolism. The
combination of these two models was made possible by the standardized enzyme
kinetic experiments carried out in both studies. This work demonstrates the
feasibility of constructing larger network models by merging smaller pathway
models.
